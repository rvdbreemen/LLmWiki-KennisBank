Question this answers: does Eaves hold anything that makes KennisBank's memory
work better when several agents use it at the same time?

## Executive conclusion

Yes, three things — and the most valuable one is a defect it exposed in our own
code rather than anything to copy from theirs.

Eaves is the first system reviewed here that runs several agents against one
memory store as its normal mode, so it has had to answer questions KennisBank
has so far only been able to postpone. Its answers are cruder than ours
everywhere the *lifecycle* of a fragment is concerned — no judge, no status,
no supersession, no validity interval, key-overwrite as the only update — and
sharper than ours everywhere *several writers* are concerned. That split is
exactly what makes it worth reading: it is weak where we are strong, so the
overlap is small and the transferable part is unusually clean.

The three findings, in descending order of value:

1. **Our SessionStart freshness gate is vault-global, not per client.** A
   second agent starting within 300 seconds of the first silently receives no
   memory-health notice, no distillation notice, no orientation and no
   upstream warning. This is ours, not Eaves' — asking their question of our
   code is what surfaced it. **TASK-200.**
2. **Our reranker multiplies metadata onto a relevance term RRF has
   flattened.** Checking Eaves' criticism of RRF against our code turned up
   more than a fusion choice: on a top-8 memory recall the RRF relevance spread
   is 1.12x while the six `_rank.py` multipliers span 5.68x, so recency alone
   outweighs the entire relevance ordering. The cosine that carries the real
   gradient is already computed and already returned on every hit — and
   `rerank` ignores it. **TASK-201.**
3. **A working-state tier that is held, not retrieved.** Eaves keeps small,
   always-in-context, agent-edited core-memory blocks alongside the searchable
   archive. KennisBank has the archive and the retrieval, and its only
   equivalent of a running summary — `kb-checkpoint.py` — is written by hand.
   **TASK-202.**

Nothing in Eaves' capture or lifecycle handling should be adopted. Details
under "Rejected".

## What Eaves is

A local-first Electron desktop app (TypeScript, better-sqlite3) for talking to
several model providers — Claude, GPT, Gemini, OpenRouter, local models —
through one interface, where each configured *agent* is a persistent persona
with its own memory. Storage is SQLite on the device, extension is a sandboxed
plugin system, and sync is optional LAN peer-to-peer. The licence and the
stated privacy position are close enough to KennisBank's that the comparison is
fair rather than aspirational: same locality constraint, same "no cloud without
asking" default, a different application shape.

Its memory is three separate mechanisms, and the separation is the design:

**`memory_blocks` — core memory, per agent, always in context.** Labelled
blocks (`human`, `current_focus` seeded by default), each with a `char_limit`
of 2000 and a `read_only` flag. The agent edits them itself through exactly two
tools, `core_memory_replace` and `core_memory_append`. There is deliberately no
read tool: the blocks are already in the prompt, so reading them is free and a
tool call would only waste a turn.

**`memory_entries` — the archive, shared by every agent.** Key/value with
free-form JSON metadata, an FTS5 index over value+key, and a `vec0` table whose
dimensions are bound at runtime to the active embedder's signature. Writes are
upserts by key; embedding happens asynchronously after the durable write, so a
store never blocks on an embedding call. Search fuses bm25 and vector distance.

**`agent_memories` — a per-agent review queue.** Rows are created with status
`candidate` and move to `approved` through a UI, individually or in bulk. It is
the human gate that the rest of the system does not use: nothing in the archive
path passes through it.

Around those sit two services that matter more to this review than the storage
does — `ShadowService` and `ChannelDispatcher` — described below.

## The multi-agent question, answered concretely

Eaves' answer has four parts. Each one is a decision KennisBank will have to
make, whether or not it makes the same one.

### 1. Two tiers, two scopes

Core memory is **private per agent** (`memory_blocks.agent_id`, and every read
goes through `getByAgent(agentId)`). The archive is **one shared pool**: any
agent can `search_memories` its way to anything any other agent stored.

That split is the whole model, and it is a good one. Working state — who am I
talking to, what am I in the middle of — is per agent because it *is* per
agent. Durable facts are shared because a fact that is true for one agent is
true for the others. Neither tier needs a permission system to be useful, which
is why the design costs almost nothing.

### 2. Attribution is written and never read

`store` puts `metadata.agentId` on the entry and the repository writes an
`agent_id` column. `search`, `list` and `retrieve` never filter on either. So
Eaves records who wrote a memory and then cannot answer a question about it.

This is TASK-194 (observer provenance) from the Honcho review, arriving from a
second direction — and with a useful extra data point: Eaves has had the column
since the schema was written and still has not used it. Writing the field is
the easy half; the value is in what reads it. TASK-194's acceptance criteria
already say so (criterion #4, "queryable from the index for per-client recall
measurement"). This review changes nothing about that task except its
confidence.

### 3. Observer agents ("shadows")

A shadow is a real agent with `archetype.type === 'shadow'`. It may name a
`leadAgentId`, in which case it sees only that agent's events, or omit it, in
which case it sees everything. Instances are keyed by the *shadow's* id, so
several shadows can watch one lead. Each buffers events until 20 have arrived
or 90 seconds have passed, renders them into a digest capped at 4000
characters, and asks its own model for a JSON object with two fields: a `focus`
string that replaces the target's `current_focus` block wholesale, and a list
of durable `facts` upserted into the archive by key. Memories land against the
lead when there is one, against the shadow itself when there is not. There is
no human gate; the Memory view is described in the code as "the correction
surface".

The *architecture* here is the interesting part and the *policy* is the part to
leave alone. An observer that is itself an agent, scoped either to one lead or
to everything, is a clean way to express "extract memory from what is
happening" without wiring extraction into the turn loop. But writing a
model's raw JSON straight into memory with no verification is a step backwards
from what `_judge.py` and the status lifecycle already do here.

### 4. Agent-to-agent traffic is bounded by a budget, not a lock

`ChannelDispatcher` runs turns only from explicit dispatch intents. Its comment
is worth quoting because it records a real incident: "Deliberately NO
message:created / message:updated subscriptions: repository storage events
never start a turn (ADR-001 Decision 3 — this also closes the forged-event
dispatch chain from #39)." On top of that sit `MAX_CHAIN_DEPTH = 3`, a
2-second per-channel cooldown, and an active-dispatch set.

KennisBank has no agent-to-agent messaging and should not acquire any. The
transferable lesson is narrower and it is about *our* concurrency work: a
storage event is not an authorisation to do work. TASK-183 (the index-lock
handoff window) is the same class of problem — two workers deciding
independently that it is their turn.

## Where the two designs agree

Independently, and therefore worth noting:

- **Bounded context assembly.** `buildMemoryContext` caps its archive manifest
  at 60 entries and emits keys, tags and descriptions but never values, with
  an explicit "… and N more (N total)" tail. The commit comment says it
  "replaces the old raw `list('agent:{id}:*')` dump". TASK-193 reached the same
  conclusion here and is Done.
- **Writes never block on the network.** Their `store` returns as soon as the
  row and the FTS entry are durable, then embeds in the background; our sweep
  is off the hot path for the same reason (PRINCIPLES #1).
- **Bounded, resumable backfill.** `backfillVectors(max)` embeds in batches of
  32, stops on the first failing batch, and returns a count — the same shape as
  `embed-sweep.py`.
- **The vector table is bound to the embedder.** `ensureVecTable(signature,
  dims)` drops and rebuilds when either changes, because vectors from a
  different model are incomparable. ADR-0001 and the `unit_norm` marker in
  `_kbindex.py` are our version of the same rule.

Four independent arrivals at the same answer is decent evidence those four are
structural rather than taste.

## Adopted

### TASK-200 — the freshness gate needs to be per client

`kb-session-start.py` reads one state file for the whole vault
(`state_path = runtime / STATE_NAME`, line 492) and gates on elapsed time alone
(`is_fresh`, line 256). `_write_state` records which client last completed —
and nothing reads it.

The gate conflates two different questions:

- *Has the maintenance work been done recently?* Vault-global, and correctly so:
  the index only needs rebuilding once no matter how many agents start.
- *Has **this agent** been told what it needs to know?* Per client, and
  currently answered with the wrong state.

Concretely: start Claude Code, then start Codex 60 seconds later. The second
session returns early at line 524 and never runs NOTIFICATIONS, so it gets no
`memory-notify` health warning, no `distill-notify` prompt, no orientation
summary and no `git-upstream-check`. The agent is not told anything is wrong;
the output is simply empty, which is indistinguishable from "nothing to report".
Silence is the designed success signal of every one of those scripts, which is
what makes the failure invisible.

`kb-checkpoint.py` already sits deliberately in front of the gate for a related
reason (TASK-79: a `source=compact` start is nearly always inside the window).
That is the same problem solved once, for one script, by moving it out of the
gate — rather than by fixing the gate.

The fix is small: key the freshness state per client while leaving the
maintenance lock global. Notifications are cheap reads; maintenance is not.

### TASK-202 — a working-state tier, shared rather than per agent

The one place KennisBank should deliberately *invert* Eaves' design.

Eaves scopes `current_focus` per agent because its agents are different
personas with different jobs. KennisBank has one subject: the vault owner's
work. "What is being worked on right now" is the same answer for Claude Code,
Codex and the Copilot CLI, and each of them currently rediscovers it from
scratch. A shared focus block is both cheaper than per-agent blocks and more
useful — it is the mechanism by which three clients stop feeling like three
systems.

We have the manual version already: `/checkpoint` writes markdown, and
`kb-checkpoint.py --notify` surfaces it before the freshness gate. What is
missing is the automatic sibling. Per PRINCIPLES #3, what needs manual
discipline does not happen.

Scope discipline matters here. This must not become a second memory layer: one
small block, hard character cap, written by the existing off-hot-path sweep,
injected at SessionStart, no retrieval and no index. If it needs a rank factor,
it has become something else and the task is wrong.

## Adopted, pending measurement

### TASK-201 — the relevance term is flattened, and the fix is already in the row

The sharpest outcome of the review, and it is not a thing to copy — it is a
thing their comment made us go and check.

Eaves' `fuseScores` carries this justification: RRF "keeps only rank and, on a
small corpus, collapses every hit into a ~0.03 blur", while weighted min-max
"preserves the gradient". The obvious reading here was that this bears on
TASK-128, where the memory layer's lexical arm was measured worthless and
removed. The larger consequence is downstream.

`_kbindex.search` emits `score = 1/(60 + rank)`. `_rank.rerank` multiplies that
by recency x importance x trust x usage x noise x coupling. The two ranges do
not meet:

| term | spread |
|---|---|
| RRF relevance, top-5 | 1.07x |
| RRF relevance, top-8 | 1.12x |
| RRF relevance, top-20 | 1.32x |
| recency alone | 1.67x |
| all six multipliers combined | 5.68x |

On a top-8 memory recall, recency alone outweighs the entire relevance
ordering, and the six factors together outweigh it by roughly five to one. A
rank-7 hit that is fresh, important and recently used displaces the rank-0 hit
by construction. The reranker is not reweighting relevance on the memory layer;
it is substantially replacing it.

Two honest qualifications. With one arm — the memory layer's configuration
since TASK-128 — RRF is a monotone transform of the vector ranking, so the
order going *into* `rerank` is right; only its magnitude is gone. And in the
two-layer path FTS does run, so a document in both rankings earns up to 2x,
which is the largest relevance signal RRF can emit and still small against
5.68x.

The fix does not require importing anything. `_kbindex.search` already computes
the cosine via `_cosine_from_l2` — its own comment calls it free, because the
distance comes out of the same KNN query and was being thrown away until now
(in the original Dutch: "Dat is gratis: de afstand komt uit dezelfde KNN-query
en werd tot nu toe weggegooid") — already returns it on every hit, and
`kb-recall.recall_hits` already carries it through to the dicts `rerank`
receives. `rerank` reads `score` and ignores `cos`. The signal
with the gradient is computed, carried, and dropped one function short of where
it is needed.

So: use the cosine as the relevance term on the single-arm memory path, and
reach for Eaves' weighted min-max only on the two-arm wiki path, where a fused
score is genuinely required. Their caveat carries over unchanged and is why the
`min_cos` floor stays on the raw cosine: min-max is intra-query relative, never
cross-query calibrated, so neither a normalised nor a fused score may become a
`score > X` gate.

This reopens two closed questions. TASK-128 could not distinguish "the lexical
arm is worthless" from "equal weight is wrong", because RRF has no weights.
And TASK-160 warned that the eval set "structurally favours similarity and
penalises recency and importance" — while the arithmetic above says production
carries the opposite bias. Both can hold at once, and together they mean the
factor defaults were tuned against a metric tilted the other way from the
system it was tuning.

The spread table is arithmetic and needs no vault. The cosine's spread across a
real candidate pool does, and it is the first thing to measure: if the cosine is
nearly as flat as the RRF score on this corpus, the finding weakens a lot, and
that should be said plainly rather than worked around.

## Rejected, with reasons

**Key-overwrite as the update mechanism.** `store` upserts by key, so a
corrected fact destroys the one it corrects. There is no supersession chain, no
`valid_from`/`valid_until`, no status. KennisBank's bi-temporal model exists
because "what did I believe in June" is a real question; `narrowed-supersede`
was written last week precisely to stop supersession from being too
destructive. Adopting this would undo two months of work.

**Unverified writes.** `consolidateDream` writes model output into memory with
no judge and no gate. Our capture path — extract, embed, dedup, reconcile,
judge, status — is the more expensive and better answer, and TASK-178 covers
making it fully autonomous without lowering the bar.

**`expires_at` without a pruner.** Their `AgentMemoryRepository` carries an
honest comment: the column exists, nothing writes it, the prune was deleted
because wiring it up "would have been a permanent no-op that read as coverage."
Not a defect to adopt — a habit to keep. It is the same lesson TASK-160 found
in `trust_factor`: a field with one value is not a field.

**The candidate/approved review queue.** `agent_memories` is a human gate that
the archive path does not use, so it gates nothing while looking like it does.
Our direction is the opposite (TASK-178, autonomous lifecycle, no required
human approval).

**Per-agent private core memory.** Correct for their application shape, wrong
for ours — see TASK-202.

**Everything about channels.** No agent-to-agent messaging here, so no loop
budget needed. The generalisable half — a storage event must never authorise
work — is already the shape of TASK-183.

## Checked and deliberately not filed

Two ideas that looked adoptable, were measured, and did not survive the
measurement. Recorded so the next review does not re-derive them.

**Deferred tool schemas.** `toolDeferral.ts` keeps expensive, rarely-called
tools off the wire until something enables them, on the reasoning that "tool
schemas are resent on every step of every turn". They measured ~7,400 tokens of
tool schema against a 151-token system prompt — about 88% of each step's input.
Measuring `kb-mcp.py` the same way: 8 tools, **5,947 characters ≈ 1,486 tokens**
of tool surface, plus ~200 for `instructions=`. Of that, the temporal family
(`what_did_i_do`, `timeline`, `weeklog`, `topic_timeline`) is 54% and the review
family (`review_pending`, `review_decide`) is 21% — so ~75% goes to tools used
in a deliberate minority of turns, which is exactly their deferral criterion.

It still does not transfer. Their mechanism works because they own the agent
loop and can withhold a registered tool from a step. An MCP server does not own
its client's loop; the client decides what to put in front of the model. What
is left is collapsing the temporal family into fewer tools, which trades ~400
tokens against a model's ability to pick the right one — a real cost, on the
retrieval path, for a fifth of what Eaves was paying. Not worth a task until
something says the tool surface is actually hurting.

**A live "what is running right now" registry.** `ActiveWorkRegistry` exists
because "the activity log answers what happened; nothing answered what is
happening", with live state scattered across five private maps. KennisBank has
the same shape — `_activity.py` answers what happened, `agent-status.py`
answers what is *installed*, and nothing answers what is running. But we have
exactly one long-running thing (the index/sweep worker), `memory-notify.py`
already reads its lock via `_worker_running()`, and TASK-183 covers the one real
coordination defect. A registry for a single worker is ceremony. KISS says no.

## What this says about KennisBank's position

The field review's conclusion holds and gains a data point. Eaves is a fifth
independent system that solves *personalization* memory well and does not
attempt *institutional* memory at all: it remembers what you told it, never
whether remembering helped. Its `agent_memories` review queue is the only
outcome-shaped mechanism in the codebase and nothing routes through it.

What is new is the axis. Every previous review (Honcho, EverOS, EverMemOS,
Memanto) compared single-subject memory quality, where KennisBank is strong.
Eaves is the first to compare *concurrency*, and there we are behind — not
architecturally, but in the unexamined places. One shared vault, one shared
index, three clients that can start within seconds of each other, and a
freshness gate that has never been asked which client it is talking to.

The retrieval loop measures itself. The multi-client loop does not measure
itself at all, because nothing has been counting how often a second client
starts inside a first client's window. TASK-200 fixes the gate; the more
durable lesson is that "several agents at once" is a mode this vault has been
running in for two releases without a single measurement pointed at it.
