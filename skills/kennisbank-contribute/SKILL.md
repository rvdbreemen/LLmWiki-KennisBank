description: Isolate local tooling improvements made in a deployed LLmWiki-KennisBank vault and contribute them upstream as a pull request. Diffs deployed scripts/templates/commands/skill against the installed release tag, filters out personal vault content, then branches, commits, pushes, and opens a PR. Triggers: /kennisbank-contribute, "contribute kennisbank changes", "PR my kennisbank tweaks upstream".

# Kennisbank Contribute

Take local tooling edits in a deployed vault and open an upstream PR.

## Resolve paths
- `VAULT="${KENNISBANK_VAULT:-$HOME/KennisBank}"`
- `REPO="${KENNISBANK_REPO}"` — if empty, ask the user. Must be a git checkout
  of LLmWiki-KennisBank with a writable `origin` remote.

## Reverse deploy map (deployed location -> repo path)
| Deployed location | Repo path |
|---|---|
| `$VAULT/.claude/scripts/<f>` | `scripts/<f>` |
| `$VAULT/04-templates/<f>.md` | `templates/<f>.md` |
| `$HOME/.claude/commands/<f>.md` | `commands/<f>.md` |
| `$HOME/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (each skill) | `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` |

## Scope filter (NEVER contribute these)
`CLAUDE.md`, `categories.json`, `embeddings-cache.json`, any `*.bak`, the vault
content directories `00-*`..`08-*`, and `.kennisbank-version`.

For skills: only skills whose `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` path exists in the repo
at BASE — verified via `git cat-file -e "$BASE:skills/<name>/SKILL.md"` (exits
0) — are eligible. Locally-installed skills with no upstream repo counterpart
(probe exits non-zero) are excluded regardless of local edits and must NEVER
be contributed.

## Procedure
1. Read `$VAULT/.claude/.kennisbank-version` -> `BASE` (`tag`). If absent, use
   `BASE=$(git -C "$REPO" tag --sort=-v:refname | grep '^v[0-9]' | head -1)`.
2. `git -C "$REPO" fetch --tags --quiet`.
3. For each deployed location in the reverse deploy map, CRLF-agnostic diff the
   deployed file against `BASE`'s version of the mapped repo path:
   `diff --strip-trailing-cr <(git -C "$REPO" show "$BASE:<repopath>") "<deployed>"`.
   For skills, iterate over every installed skill under
   `$HOME/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` and for each resolve its name and check
   whether the repo counterpart exists at BASE:
   `git -C "$REPO" cat-file -e "$BASE:skills/<name>/SKILL.md"`.
   If this exits non-zero (exit 128 when the path is absent), SKIP it silently
   — it is a locally-installed personal skill with no upstream repo counterpart
   and is NEVER a contribute candidate. A skill absent at BASE must NEVER be
   routed to "added"; the "missing BASE = added" rule applies ONLY to scripts,
   templates, and commands — NOT to skills.
   For skills confirmed to exist at BASE (probe exits 0), diff against
   `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` at that ref. Collect changed repo paths, applying
   the scope filter.
4. If nothing qualifies, report "no contributable changes" and stop.
5. Show the user the candidate file list with per-file diffs. Let them choose
   which files to include (default: all).
6. Detect the default branch and create a branch off it:
   ```
   DEFAULT=$(git -C "$REPO" symbolic-ref --quiet refs/remotes/origin/HEAD | sed 's@^refs/remotes/origin/@@')
   DEFAULT=${DEFAULT:-main}
   git -C "$REPO" checkout -b "contrib/<slug>" "$DEFAULT"
   ```
   (slug from a short user-supplied description).
7. For each selected file, copy the deployed version into the repo at its mapped
   repo path. `git -C "$REPO" add` those paths.
8. Commit with a descriptive message summarizing the change.
9. `git -C "$REPO" push -u origin "contrib/<slug>"`.
10. `gh pr create --repo <upstream> --base "$DEFAULT" --head "contrib/<slug>"` with a
    title and body describing the improvement. Report the PR URL.

## Dry-run
If invoked with `--dry-run`, perform steps 1-5 and print the branch name and the
files that would be committed, but do not create the branch, commit, push, or PR.
