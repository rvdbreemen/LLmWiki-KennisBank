description: Upgrade a deployed LLmWiki-KennisBank vault to the latest official release tag. Checks the upstream tag, shows the changelog, backs up the current deploy, copies the new tooling into the vault, stamps the version, and verifies with doctor.sh. Triggers: /kennisbank-upgrade, "upgrade kennisbank", "update kennisbank tooling".

# Kennisbank Upgrade

Upgrade a deployed vault to the latest **release tag** (never bare main).

## Resolve paths
- `VAULT="${KENNISBANK_VAULT:-$HOME/KennisBank}"`
- `REPO="${KENNISBANK_REPO}"` — if empty, ask the user for the path to their
  LLmWiki-KennisBank git checkout. Confirm it is a git repo (`git -C "$REPO" rev-parse`).

## Deploy map
| Repo source | Deploy destination |
|---|---|
| `scripts/*.py`, `scripts/*.sh` | `$VAULT/.claude/scripts/` |
| `templates/*.md` | `$VAULT/04-templates/` |
| `commands/*.md` | `$HOME/.claude/commands/` |
| `skills/autoresearch/SKILL.md` | `$HOME/.claude/skills/autoresearch/` |

`CLAUDE.md` is personalized and is NEVER overwritten.

## Procedure
1. `git -C "$REPO" fetch --tags --quiet`.
2. `LATEST=$(git -C "$REPO" tag --sort=-v:refname | grep '^v[0-9]' | head -1)`.
3. Read `$VAULT/.claude/.kennisbank-version` -> `INSTALLED` (the `tag` field).
   If the file is absent, treat as unknown/legacy and tell the user.
4. If `INSTALLED == LATEST`: report "up to date ($LATEST)" and stop.
5. Show what is NEW between versions: first run
   `git -C "$REPO" log --oneline "$INSTALLED..$LATEST"` to display the commit
   delta, then, if useful, also show the relevant CHANGELOG.md section at
   `$LATEST` (`git -C "$REPO" show "$LATEST:CHANGELOG.md"`). Keep it concise —
   the commit delta is usually enough.
6. Drift guard: for every deployed tooling file across ALL FOUR deploy-map
   categories — scripts (`$VAULT/.claude/scripts/`), templates
   (`$VAULT/04-templates/`), commands (`$HOME/.claude/commands/`), and the
   autoresearch skill (`$HOME/.claude/skills/autoresearch/SKILL.md`) — perform
   a CRLF-agnostic diff against the INSTALLED tag's version. Example for a
   script file:
   `diff --strip-trailing-cr <(git -C "$REPO" show "$INSTALLED:scripts/<f>") "$VAULT/.claude/scripts/<f>"`.
   Apply the same pattern for templates, commands, and the autoresearch skill
   using their respective repo paths from the deploy map. Do not limit the
   check to scripts only. If any file in any category differs, warn the user
   that local edits exist, point them to the `kennisbank-contribute` skill, and
   ask whether to proceed (local edits will survive only in the backup).
7. On confirmation, back up every deploy-map category that Step 6 found to have
   local drift, using the `.pre-$INSTALLED.bak` naming convention:
   - `$VAULT/.claude/scripts` -> `$VAULT/.claude/scripts.pre-$INSTALLED.bak`
   - `$VAULT/04-templates` -> `$VAULT/04-templates.pre-$INSTALLED.bak`
   - `$HOME/.claude/commands` -> `$HOME/.claude/commands.pre-$INSTALLED.bak`
   - `$HOME/.claude/skills/autoresearch` -> `$HOME/.claude/skills/autoresearch.pre-$INSTALLED.bak`
   Only back up a category if it actually has drift; skip clean ones.
8. `git -C "$REPO" -c advice.detachedHead=false checkout "$LATEST"`.
9. Copy per the deploy map: `scripts/*.py` and `scripts/*.sh` -> vault scripts;
   `templates/*.md` -> vault templates; `commands/*.md` -> `~/.claude/commands/`;
   `skills/autoresearch/SKILL.md` -> `~/.claude/skills/autoresearch/`.
   `chmod +x` the vault `.py` and `.sh` files. Do not touch `CLAUDE.md`.
10. Write `$VAULT/.claude/.kennisbank-version`:
    `{"tag":"$LATEST","commit":"<git rev-parse --short $LATEST>","installed_at":"<UTC ISO 8601>"}`.
11. `git -C "$REPO" checkout -` (return to the previously checked-out branch,
    regardless of its name).
12. Run `bash "$VAULT/.claude/scripts/doctor.sh"` and report the PASS count.

## Dry-run
If invoked with `--dry-run`, perform steps 1-6 and print the planned copies and
backups, but make no writes (no backup, no copy, no stamp, no checkout side
effects beyond fetch).
