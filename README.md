# LLmWiki-KennisBank

**English** · [Nederlands](README.nl.md)

**A sovereign memory layer for serious AI work.**

Every agent session creates valuable context: decisions, fixes, preferences,
architecture trade-offs, dead ends, and lessons you do not want to rediscover
next week. Then the model forgets. KennisBank turns that temporary context into
a durable local knowledge system for Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, the GitHub
Copilot CLI, and other developer agents.

It captures what happened, distils it into a sourced wiki, extracts time-aware
memories, retrieves the right knowledge before the next answer, and measures
whether that knowledge actually helped. The result is an AI workspace that gets
sharper over time without handing your private work to a hosted memory vendor.

Plain markdown. Local SQLite. Local Ollama by default. Your own machine. You
stay the editor-in-chief: the system proposes, quarantines, and flags, but a
human merges, supersedes, and decides. Open the vault in Obsidian and it is
just notes. Very well-organized notes that happen to power an AI memory.

## First-class coding-agent integrations

One `setup.sh` flow installs and upgrades KennisBank for **Claude Code**,
**OpenAI Codex**, and the standalone **GitHub Copilot CLI** on Windows, macOS,
and Linux. OpenCode remains supported as an additional local client.

- Skill and generated prompt descriptions are English so every client can
  discover them consistently.
- Each client registers one fail-open coordinator at session start and one at
  exit. Independent jobs run concurrently, dependent work follows in explicit
  phases. Routine no-change output stays silent.
- A client may still show one generic row for each lifecycle event; those
  UI-owned rows cannot be suppressed portably while keeping automation.
- Setup replaces only legacy KennisBank start/exit entries and preserves
  unrelated user hooks plus prompt and presearch behavior.
- The same local stdio MCP server and explicitly pinned `KENNISBANK_VAULT`
  serve every installed client.

Install or upgrade selected clients:

```bash
KENNISBANK_VAULT="/absolute/path/to/vault" bash setup.sh --yes --agents claude,codex,copilot
```

After restarting the client, use `$sessiestart` and `$sessielog` in Codex
(`/prompts:sessiestart` remains a compatibility alias), or `/sessiestart` and
`/sessielog` in Copilot for explicit on-demand workflows.

Based on [Andrej Karpathy's LLM Wiki pattern](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f): raw sessions go in, structured knowledge comes out. KennisBank extends the pattern into a closed loop:

```
capture ──> consolidate ──> retrieve ──> measure
   ^                                        │
   └────────────── learn <─────────────────┘
```

- **Capture**: session logs, transcript archiving, and an autonomous memory sweep that extracts, types, and judges candidate memories after each session.
- **Consolidate**: `/wiki` compiles sessions into wiki articles with per-claim provenance; new facts reconcile against old ones at write time (add, supersede, or drop) with a bi-temporal validity model.
- **Retrieve**: hooks inject relevant wiki articles and memories into every prompt, in any project: hybrid semantic + keyword search, ranked by relevance x recency x importance, expanded with the best-connected graph neighbour.
- **Measure**: a recall@k eval harness and a threshold calibration harness make every retrieval change testable instead of vibes-based.
- **Learn**: usage telemetry tracks which injected knowledge was actually used, boosting warm documents and keeping recently-used articles out of the stale list.

## Why this exists

Vendor memory systems (Mem0, Zep, Letta, Cognee) are powerful but cloud-shaped: your knowledge lives in their store, behind their API, on their pricing tier. KennisBank takes the two mechanisms that actually matter from that literature, temporal validity of facts and invalidation-at-write, and rebuilds them in plain markdown frontmatter plus SQLite. What you own stays portable; what the agent needs stays fast.

The design bias throughout: **deterministic where possible, LLM only where it adds judgment, fail-open everywhere**. A dead model never blocks a session, never loses a transcript, and never deletes verified knowledge.

## Feature highlights (v0.18.0)

### New in v0.18.0

- **Sub-second retrieval on the first prompt.** The `kb-retrieve` hook no longer
  times out on a cold embedding model: it embeds once per prompt, bounds the
  hot-path embed to a sub-second default, and self-heals by pre-warming the
  model at session start and firing a detached warm on a miss. Fully local and
  fail-open.
- **Upstream-drift warning.** A session-start notification warns when your git
  repository has fallen behind its upstream (current branch and/or `main`).
  cwd-aware and silent when clean; all clients get it from the one coordinator.

### New in v0.17.1

- **One coordinated start and exit hook per client.** Startup maintenance is
  phased and concurrent. Exit capture completes first, then independent usage
  attribution and Copilot import work run concurrently. Both paths are
  time-bounded, silent on routine success, and fail-open.
- **Native coordinated session workflows.** Copilot exposes `/sessiestart` and
  `/sessielog`; Codex exposes `$sessiestart` and `$sessielog` plus `/prompts:*`
  compatibility. The semantic `/sessielog` workflow invokes one deterministic
  helper for its post-save indexes, sweep launch, and notices.
- **Deterministic, non-destructive upgrade.** Setup recognizes old script
  basenames, removes only legacy KennisBank start/exit entries, deduplicates
  coordinators, and preserves unrelated hooks plus prompt/presearch behavior.

### New in v0.15
- **Multilingual temporal recall.** `/watdeedik`, `/timeline`, and `/weeklog`
  now understand dates and periods in **Dutch, English, German, French, Spanish,
  and Italian** out of the box (`vorige week`, `letzte Woche`,
  `la semaine dernière`, `la semana pasada`, `begin april`, `vor zwei Wochen`),
  with exact calendar ranges. An optional `dateparser` fallback extends coverage
  to 200+ languages, and an off-by-default local-LLM last resort handles
  compositional phrasing like "het weekend voor afgelopen maandag".
- **Richer relative phrasing.** Relative weekdays, week parts
  (`begin/midden/eind vorige week`), weekends, "N units ago" in both word orders,
  and month names with year inference are all resolved deterministically. 138
  pinned test cases guard the behaviour.

### New in v0.14
- **Local LiteParse document intake.** `/intake` and `/import documents <path>`
  parse PDFs, Office files, spreadsheets, presentations, and document-like
  images into citeable markdown under `<vault>/05-bronnen/liteparse/`.
- **Source material stays separate.** Parsed binary documents become `type: bron`
  markdown with frontmatter pointing back to the original local file, so wiki
  articles can cite them with explicit `[[05-bronnen/...]]` links instead of
  pretending they were session logs.
- **OCR is explicit.** Native-text documents parse without OCR by default; use
  `--ocr` only for scans and only when local Tesseract/tessdata is available.

### New in v0.13
- **Temporal Activity Recall.** Ask what happened on a date, during a week, or
  around a topic with `/watdeedik`, `/timeline`, and `/weeklog`. The feature
  builds a local `<vault>/.claude/kb-activity.db` from raw sessions,
  transcripts, memories, wiki updates, and usage telemetry.
- **Strict time-aware retrieval.** Dates and periods are parsed deterministically
  in Dutch and English (`vorige week`, `2026-07-03`, `3 juli 2026`,
  `between 2026-07-01 and 2026-07-07`). Range filtering is hard: events outside
  the requested period are not silently mixed in.
- **Topic timelines with evidence.** Follow subjects such as "Codex MCP" or
  "OpenRouter" through time using entities, tags, aliases, FTS and source refs.
  Local aliases can be configured in `<vault>/.claude/activity-topic-aliases.json`.
- **MCP temporal tools.** The local `kennisbank` MCP server now exposes
  `what_did_i_do`, `timeline`, `weeklog`, and `topic_timeline` alongside
  `recall` and `capture`, so Codex, OpenCode and other local agents use the same
  API as the slash commands.
- **Measured recall.** `kb-activity-eval.py` provides a temporal eval harness for
  date recall, period recall, topic timelines, negative controls and provenance
  coverage. The repo ships a non-personal example eval set.

### New in v0.12
- **One setup for install and upgrade.** `setup.sh` is now the authoritative
  path for first install, repair, and upgrade: it refreshes tooling, preserves
  user data, runs migrations, installs selected agent integrations, and blocks
  completion when validation fails.
- **Multi-agent by design.** Choose `claude`, `codex`, `opencode`, or `all`.
  Claude Code gets native commands and hooks; Codex gets shared skills,
  `/prompts:*` aliases, hooks, MCP, and `AGENTS.md`; OpenCode gets commands,
  shared skills, MCP, global rules, and a local plugin.
- **Verified local-first models.** Setup validates the selected backend before
  it returns. Ollama remains the default for local memory extraction and judging,
  including smoke tests for the configured embedding and chat models.
- **OpenRouter as explicit cloud opt-in.** If you want an external LLM for the
  judge/extraction step, setup can configure OpenRouter with a model slug and
  API-key environment variable. Secrets are never written to the repo or vault.
- **Agent-friendly operating contract.** `AGENTS.md`, `CONFIGURATION.md`, and
  the agent integration docs now spell out the active vault path, setup
  validation, Codex/OpenCode behavior, hooks, MCP, and privacy boundaries.
- **v0.12.1 Codex hotfix.** Re-running setup now repairs the Codex MCP TOML
  block without duplicating `[mcp_servers.kennisbank.env]`, and validation
  catches malformed Codex TOML before setup reports success.
- **v0.12.2 MCP runtime hotfix.** Setup now installs the Python MCP SDK for
  Codex/OpenCode targets and validates the stdio server with a real
  initialize/list-tools handshake, so a configured `kennisbank` MCP server no
  longer fails only when the agent starts.

### Knowledge (the wiki layer)
- `/wiki` compiles raw session logs into interlinked wiki articles, updating existing ones via a guarded rewrite engine (`safe-edit.py`) instead of clobbering them.
- **Provenance-lint** (`kb-lint.py`): every article must trace back to its sources with resolving wikilinks to a raw session or an imported source; `/wiki` writes that provenance per key point at distillation time. A hallucination during distillation can no longer become a permanent "fact" that nobody can check.
- `/stale` finds outdated articles, and usage telemetry keeps warm articles out of the list: an article you used last week is not stale, however old its `updated` date.
- Thinking tools: `/reconcile` surfaces contradictions between articles, `/uitdaag` adversarially challenges a claim, `/brug` finds conceptual bridges between two topics.

### Memory (the agent layer)
- An autonomous **capture sweep** runs detached in the background (launched at session start, over transcripts archived at session end): extract candidates, type them (`feit`, `voorkeur`, `procedure`, `beslissing`), deduplicate, and let an independent judge decide `current` versus quarantine (`unverified`) with an importance score (1-5).
- **Bi-temporal validity**: every memory carries `valid_from` (event time, from the session date) separate from `created` (capture time); superseding or expiring a fact stamps `valid_until`. The system knows not just what is true, but since when and until when.
- **Write-time invalidation** (Mem0 pattern, local): a new fact reconciles against the most similar existing memories at write time: ADD, SUPERSEDE (the old fact is closed and linked), or NOOP. A deterministic temporal guard ensures an older fact can never invalidate a newer one, so bulk re-imports are safe.
- Cross-memory maintenance: supersede pass, noise recheck, and cluster promotion (recurring themes get flagged as wiki candidates).

### Retrieval (the hooks layer)
- **Every prompt, every project**: a UserPromptSubmit hook embeds your prompt and injects the top-matching wiki articles and memories as context. A PreToolUse hook checks the vault before Claude searches the web.
- Hybrid index (`kb-index.db`): semantic vectors (sqlite-vec) fused with FTS5 keyword search, so exact terms are found even when embeddings miss them.
- Ranking: relevance x recency (half-life per memory type) x importance, plus a usage boost for documents that recently proved useful.
- **Graph-neighbour expansion**: the most-referenced wikilink neighbour of your hits rides along as one extra entry, turning loose hits into a coherent knowledge neighbourhood.

### Measurement (the trust layer)
- `kb-eval.py`: recall@1/3/5 and MRR against your personal eval set of questions. Run it before and after any retrieval change; a drop is a regression, not an opinion.
- `kb-activity-eval.py`: temporal recall evals for date questions, period questions, topic timelines, negative controls and source-ref coverage.
- `kb-calibrate.py`: checks all cosine thresholds (dedup, rewrite, reconcile, conflict, retrieve) against the active embedding model using a hand-labelled pair set, and proposes boundaries with separation margins. It writes nothing: you decide. Switch embedding models without silently degrading.
- `doctor.sh`: one command verifies the whole install, from vault layout and hook registration to provenance coverage.

### Sovereignty (the whole point)
- Local Ollama models for both embeddings and judgment, swappable via config (`kennisbank-embed.json`, `kennisbank-llm.json`); OpenAI-compatible endpoints supported when you choose to.
- LiteParse 2.x for local PDF/Office/image document parsing during intake.
- Everything is markdown + SQLite in a folder you own. Obsidian-compatible. MIT-licensed.
- Human update authority: agents never silently delete; superseded knowledge is closed and linked, quarantined knowledge cannot displace verified knowledge, and large rewrites require your confirmation.

## Prerequisites

- At least one local agent client: [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), Codex, OpenCode, or the [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/set-up-copilot-cli/install-copilot-cli)
- Python 3.10+
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com) with:
  - `qwen3-embedding:8b` (embeddings; multilingual default. English-only vaults can use the lighter `nomic-embed-text`)
  - a chat model for the memory judge/extraction (default `gemma4:latest`; pin another via `<vault>/.claude/kennisbank-llm.json`)

Ollama is optional in the sense that everything fails open without it, but the memory sweep, semantic retrieval, and deduplication are the heart of the system: install it. For the **LLM judge/extraction only**, setup can also configure OpenRouter as an explicit cloud opt-in. Embeddings remain local by default.

The setup creates two root directories by default:
- `~/KennisBank/` - the vault (wiki, logs, memory, templates, scripts)
- `~/Claude/research/` - output directory for `/autoresearch`

Both paths are configurable. For a non-default vault, set `KENNISBANK_VAULT` when running setup; that same value is written into agent hooks and MCP config so clients do not fall back to `~/KennisBank`.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jvdbreemen/LLmWiki-KennisBank.git
cd LLmWiki-KennisBank
bash setup.sh           # interactive
bash setup.sh --yes     # non-interactive (recommended for AI agents)
KENNISBANK_VAULT="/absolute/path/to/vault" bash setup.sh --yes --agents claude,codex,opencode
```

In one idempotent run, the setup script:
- creates the vault directory structure under `$KENNISBANK_VAULT` or `~/KennisBank/`
- copies scripts and templates into place
- bootstraps the settings toggles and runs version-gated migrations
- asks which agent environments to install (`claude`, `codex`, `opencode`, or `all`; default `claude,codex`)
- installs Claude Code commands/skills/hooks when `claude` is selected
- installs Codex command skills, `/prompts:*` compatibility aliases, MCP config,
  and global `AGENTS.md`; upgrades remove old KennisBank Codex hooks
- installs OpenCode commands, shared skills, MCP config, global `AGENTS.md`, and a local plugin hook when `opencode` is selected
- installs Copilot command skills, MCP config, personal instructions, and a
  custom agent profile; upgrades remove old KennisBank Copilot hooks
- asks for the LLM backend in interactive mode: default `ollama`, optional `openrouter` with model slug and API key env-var
- validates the install before returning: `doctor.sh`, agent config checks, MCP runtime handshake for Codex/OpenCode, local Ollama smoke tests, and OpenRouter smoke tests when OpenRouter is selected

**Re-running `setup.sh` is safe and is the upgrade mechanism**: it refreshes tooling and repairs agent config without clobbering user data, customizations, or vault contents. The `/kennisbank-upgrade` skill wraps it with release-tag checkout, drift detection, backups, version stamping, and the same post-install validation.

Useful flags:

```bash
bash setup.sh --yes --agents claude,codex      # default non-interactive target set
bash setup.sh --yes --agents all               # Claude Code + Codex + OpenCode + Copilot
bash setup.sh --yes --agents codex             # Codex only
bash setup.sh --yes --skip-model-check         # CI/offline validation without Ollama smoke tests
```

For OpenRouter, setup writes only non-secret config to
`<vault>/.claude/kennisbank-llm.json`: provider, model, endpoint, and
`api_key_env`. The API key itself must be in the named environment variable
or, if you enter it during setup, in the user-local secrets file
`~/.config/kennisbank/secrets.json`. It is never written to the repo or vault.

After install, read [POST-INSTALL.md](POST-INSTALL.md) for the first-session walkthrough.

### The hookset

Claude Code, Codex, and Copilot each receive one SessionStart coordinator and
one exit coordinator plus their prompt/tool hooks. The table names coordinator
children as jobs, not separately registered handlers. OpenCode receives MCP
plus a global plugin under `~/.config/opencode/plugins/`.

| Hook | Script | What it does |
|------|--------|--------------|
| SessionStart | `kb-session-start.py` | Coordinate concurrent index/sweep jobs, then notices; emit one actionable report |
| Coordinator job | `build-embed-index.py`, `build-kb-index.py`, `build-activity-index.py`, `sweep-launch.py` | Run independent maintenance concurrently |
| Coordinator notice | `memory-notify.py`, `distill-notify.py` | Report health/actions after maintenance |
| UserPromptSubmit | `kb-retrieve.py` | Inject matching wiki + memory context into the prompt |
| SessionEnd/Stop | `kb-session-end.py` | Capture the transcript/event first; then attribute usage and import Copilot activity concurrently |
| Exit coordinator capture | `archive-transcript.py` or `kb-copilot-capture.py` | Persist the client-native session source before follow-up work |
| Exit coordinator jobs | `kb-usage-scan.py`, Copilot `import-copilot.py` | Attribute useful recall and make Copilot activity immediately indexable |
| PreToolUse (WebSearch\|WebFetch) | `kb-presearch.py` | Consult the vault before searching the web |

The hooks are fail-open by design: an error means no injected context or a skipped background step, never a blocked session.

## Commands reference

| Command | Arguments | What it does |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| `/sessielog` | none | Writes and curates the semantic session log, then runs one mechanical post-save coordinator |

| `/kennisbank-contribute` | optional `--dry-run` | PR local tooling edits back upstream |

## Skills

Three skills ship with the system. Claude Code gets them under `~/.claude/skills/`; Codex and OpenCode get them under the shared user skill location `~/.agents/skills/`, which both clients discover. Commands are single prompts; skills are multi-step procedures with their own guardrails.

| Skill | Invoked via | What it does |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| `autoresearch` | `/autoresearch <topic>` or "research/deep dive/onderzoek [topic]" | Autonomous iterative research loop: multi-round web searches, synthesis, and one structured, cited document in `~/Claude/research/`. Checks your own vault first (lazy hierarchy) so research fills gaps instead of repeating what you already know. Built on Karpathy's autoresearch pattern. |
| `kennisbank-upgrade` | `/kennisbank-upgrade [--dry-run]` | Upgrades a deployed vault to the latest official release tag (never bare main): fetches tags, shows the changelog delta, detects local drift with a CRLF-agnostic diff, backs up drifted categories, deploys via `setup.sh`, stamps the installed version, and verifies with `doctor.sh`. |
| `kennisbank-contribute` | `/kennisbank-contribute [--dry-run]` | The reverse direction: isolates local tooling edits in a deployed vault (scripts, templates, commands, skills), filters out personal vault content, then branches, commits, pushes, and opens an upstream PR. Ownership equals durability: improvements survive the next upgrade because they land upstream. |

Upgrade and contribute are two halves of one loop: `contribute` sends your local improvements upstream, `upgrade` brings released improvements back down. A vault that follows both never drifts permanently from the project.

## Vault structure

```
~/KennisBank/
  00-inbox/        Drop files here for processing
  01-raw/
    sessies/       Session logs (raw-sessie-YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md)

  02-wiki/         Compiled wiki articles
  03-projecten/    Project-specific notes
  04-templates/    Article and log templates
  05-bronnen/      Source materials and references
  06-claude/       Claude-internal context files, eval + calibration sets
  07-media/        Media descriptions and asset metadata (not the binaries)
  08-archive/      Archived articles
  09-memory/       Agent memory (typed, judged, bi-temporal; archive/ for retired items)

    kb-usage.db    Usage telemetry (survives rebuilds and model switches)
  graphify-out/    Knowledge graph output (optional)
```

## Background automation toggles

Seven background behaviours are individual toggles in `kennisbank-settings.json`, managed with `/kennisbank:settings`:

| Toggle | Default | Controls |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `auto_archive` | off | Archive the transcript at session end |
| `distill_notify` | on | Notify at start that transcripts are pending |
| `embed_index` | on | Refresh the wiki embedding cache at start |
| `daily_graphify` | on | Update the knowledge graph once a day |
| `memory_capture` | on | Extract and judge memories into `09-memory/` |
| `memory_recall` | on | Inject memories into context via hooks |
| `usage_telemetry` | on | Track which injected knowledge gets used |

## Measuring your retrieval

Two harnesses keep the system honest:

```bash
# recall@k against your personal eval set (06-claude/kb-eval-set.json)
python3 ~/KennisBank/.claude/scripts/kb-eval.py

# threshold calibration against the active embedding model
python3 ~/KennisBank/.claude/scripts/kb-calibrate.py
```

Maintain the eval set as your vault grows (questions you know the answer to, with the expected article), and run both harnesses after any change to thresholds, models, or ranking. Example sets ship in the repo root.

## Migrating from older Claude tooling

The `/import` command backfills the vault from existing Claude history. It handles Claude Code session JSONL files under `~/.claude/projects/`, claude.ai export bundles, Mac desktop Claude (Cowork) conversation data, and any generic markdown or text folder. Each importer writes raw session files that `/wiki` can compile afterwards. For the memory layer, `/kennisbank:rebuild-memory` re-extracts all archived transcripts through the full sweep (semantic dedup makes re-runs near-idempotent).

For binary/source documents, `/intake` and `/import documents <path>` use
LiteParse 2.x locally to turn PDFs, Office files, spreadsheets, presentations,
and document-like images into markdown under `05-bronnen/liteparse/`. This does
not call a cloud parser or an LLM. OCR is opt-in (`--ocr`) so native-text PDFs
do not get polluted by missing Tesseract/tessdata diagnostics; Office/image
formats may still require local LibreOffice/ImageMagick tooling as LiteParse
reports.

## Using KennisBank from other agents (Codex, OpenCode, Copilot, ChatGPT)

The vault is not Claude-Code-only. `scripts/kb-mcp.py` is a local **MCP server** exposing three primitives - `recall` (search memory + wiki), `capture` (save a new memory), and an `instructions` resource (a nudge to pull before searching externally). MCP is the one protocol every modern agent already speaks, so any client running **on this machine** can use the vault.

**The hard boundary: local only.** The MCP server binds nothing to the network
(stdio transport); the vault never leaves your machine. Claude Code, Codex,
GitHub Copilot CLI, OpenCode, and compatible local stdio clients can reach it
directly. Agents that run *in the cloud* (hosted ChatGPT) cannot reach a local
stdio server, and the answer is **not** to tunnel your sovereign vault to the
internet - it is the manual bridge below.

### Codex CLI

`setup.sh --agents codex` installs:

- `~/.agents/skills/<command>/SKILL.md`, including `sessiestart`, `sessielog`,
  temporal commands, and the hand-authored KennisBank skills
- `~/.codex/prompts/*.md` aliases, invoked as `/prompts:sessielog`, `/prompts:sessiestart`, `/prompts:kennisbank-upgrade`, etc.
- `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` with the active vault path
- `~/.codex/hooks.json` with one SessionStart and one exit coordinator plus
  fail-open prompt/tool hooks
- `~/.codex/config.toml` MCP server `kennisbank`

Use `$sessiestart` and `$sessielog` as native Codex skills. Codex does not
expose arbitrary bare slash aliases; the deprecated prompt compatibility form
is `/prompts:<name>`. KennisBank installs one start and one exit coordinator.
Codex may show one client-owned row per lifecycle event, but routine output
stays silent. Setup replaces legacy start/exit entries while
preserving unrelated and non-startup hooks. MCP tools remain available through
the configured `kennisbank` server, and setup proves the server starts before
reporting success.

Manual MCP equivalent:

```bash
py -3 -m pip install mcp==1.28.1
```


```toml
[mcp_servers.kennisbank]
command = "py"
args = ["-3", "/absolute/path/to/vault/.claude/scripts/kb-mcp.py"]

[mcp_servers.kennisbank.env]
KENNISBANK_VAULT = "/absolute/path/to/vault"
KB_LLM_PROVIDERS = "ollama"
KB_LLM_MODEL = "gemma4:12b"
KB_LLM_ENDPOINT = "http://localhost:11434"
```

### OpenCode

`setup.sh --agents opencode` installs:

- `~/.config/opencode/commands/*.md`, invoked as `/sessielog`, `/sessiestart`, `/kennisbank-upgrade`, etc.
- `~/.agents/skills/{autoresearch,kennisbank-upgrade,kennisbank-contribute}/`
- `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md` with the active vault path
- `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` MCP server `kennisbank`
- `~/.config/opencode/plugins/kennisbank.js`, a fail-open local plugin for session maintenance events

OpenCode reads global commands directly from `~/.config/opencode/commands/`, so the command names match the Claude Code names. Retrieval should use the MCP `recall` tool and the installed skills; the plugin handles background maintenance where OpenCode exposes matching events.

### GitHub Copilot CLI - a first-class local agent

The **standalone** GitHub Copilot CLI (`npm install -g @github/copilot`, invoked as `copilot`) is a managed KennisBank target, exactly like Codex and OpenCode - not a hand-written snippet. One local vault, one stdio MCP server, one local recall layer, now shared across all four agents. Whatever you do in a Copilot session becomes searchable KennisBank history next to your Claude Code, Codex, and OpenCode work; ask `/watdeedik` or `/timeline` and Copilot's sessions show up alongside the rest.

```bash
KENNISBANK_VAULT="/absolute/path/to/vault" bash setup.sh --yes --agents copilot
```

`setup.sh --agents copilot` installs, idempotently and login-free:

- `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json` - MCP server `kennisbank` (`recall`, `capture`, and the temporal tools), registered by a key-scoped JSON merge and validated with a real initialize/list-tools handshake
- `~/.copilot/hooks/kennisbank.json` - one cross-platform SessionStart
  coordinator plus fail-open activity capture hooks
- `~/.copilot/copilot-instructions.md` - a KennisBank managed instruction block
- `~/.copilot/agents/kennisbank.agent.md` - a custom agent profile, selected with `copilot --agent kennisbank`
- native slash-command skills at `~/.agents/skills/`, including
  `/sessiestart`, `/sessielog`, `/weeklog`, and `/timeline` (list with
  `copilot skill list`)

KennisBank coordinates startup behind one hook because Copilot has no hook
field that hides its own timeline rows. One generic row can remain; six to
eight old rows become one. On upgrade, setup removes only known legacy
SessionStart commands and leaves unrelated entries untouched.

Run Copilot through the wrapper to pin the vault and local-LLM env: `python3 <vault>/.claude/scripts/kennisbank-copilot.py` (a trivial exec that hands off to the real `copilot`; `--kb-doctor`, `--kb-dry-run`, and `--kb-print-env` work without a GitHub login).

**The cloud boundary is precise.** Copilot is cloud-backed - a live model turn
needs a GitHub Copilot subscription and sends requests to GitHub. Your vault,
recall, MCP server, skills, and instructions stay local; their installation and
`copilot mcp list` work without login. The integration is opt-in. See
[agent integrations](docs/agent-integrations.md), the original
[Copilot ADR](docs/adr/0003-copilot-cli-integration.md), and the
[SessionStart coordinator ADR](docs/adr/ADR-006-coordinate-sessionstart-work-behind-one-client-hook.md)
and [session logging/exit coordinator ADR](docs/adr/ADR-007-coordinate-session-logging-and-exit-work-behind-one-client-hook.md).

### GitHub Copilot (VS Code agent mode) - works, with one caveat

This is Copilot's **VS Code agent mode** (MCP tools inside the editor) - a different, manual integration from the standalone GitHub Copilot CLI covered above. Copilot's agent mode supports MCP **tools** over stdio, but **not** MCP resources or prompts. So `recall` and `capture` work, but the `instructions` nudge (a resource) will not surface. Put the nudge in `.github/copilot-instructions.md` instead:

```markdown
You have a local KennisBank via MCP tools `recall` and `capture`.
Call `recall` before searching externally; call `capture` to save a reusable fact.
```

Register the server in VS Code settings (`mcp.json` / `"servers"`):

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "kennisbank": {
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/vault/.claude/scripts/kb-mcp.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

The wider adapter registry and the rest of the client snippets live in
[docs/agent-integrations.md](docs/agent-integrations.md).

### ChatGPT - the manual bridge (sovereignty first)

Hosted ChatGPT can only connect to **remote** MCP servers on the public internet; exposing a local server means tunnelling (Secure Tunnel / ngrok / Cloudflare), which routes your queries **and** the returned knowledge through OpenAI's infrastructure. That breaks the whole point of a sovereign vault, so KennisBank does not do it by default. Instead, **you** stay the gate:

```bash
python3 .claude/scripts/kb-ask.py "how did I fix the ESP32 BLE crash"
python3 .claude/scripts/kb-ask.py "my topic" --k 8 --clip   # also copy to clipboard
```

`kb-ask` retrieves locally and prints a ready-to-paste context block (a short instruction for the model, then the hits, then your question). Paste it at the top of your ChatGPT message. Nothing leaves the machine automatically - you choose what to share.

### ChatGPT data export - get control of your own chats back

You can pull your ChatGPT history *into* the sovereign vault, so lessons from those conversations become your own retrievable knowledge instead of living only in OpenAI's cloud:

1. In ChatGPT, open **Settings → Data controls → Export data** and confirm. (Requires being signed in on the web app.)
2. OpenAI emails you a download link within minutes to a day; the link is time-limited. Download the ZIP - it contains `conversations.json` (plus `chat.html`, media).
3. Import it into the vault:
   ```bash
   python3 .claude/scripts/import-chatgpt-export.py --input ~/Downloads/chatgpt-export.zip
   # preview first if you like:
   python3 .claude/scripts/import-chatgpt-export.py --input ~/Downloads/chatgpt-export.zip --dry-run --verbose
   ```
   Each conversation becomes a raw session log under `01-raw/sessies/`. Then run `/wiki` to compile them into articles and `/kennisbank:rebuild-memory` to extract the memory layer. Re-imports are skip-by-default (idempotent); pass `--force` to overwrite.

The importer walks ChatGPT's message *tree* (`mapping`), orders turns by timestamp, and keeps only your and the assistant's turns - system and tool nodes are dropped. It runs fully locally; nothing is sent anywhere.

## Customization

1. Edit `<vault>/CLAUDE.md` after setup. Replace `[YOUR NAME]` and `[YOUR PROJECTS]` with your own. For a non-default install, `<vault>` is the exact `KENNISBANK_VAULT` path you used.
2. **Vault path.** All Python scripts, `doctor.sh`, and generated agent integrations honor the `KENNISBANK_VAULT` environment variable (default `~/KennisBank`). See [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md) section 9 for the non-default vault contract.
3. **Embedding backend.** Swappable via `<vault>/.claude/kennisbank-embed.json` or `KB_EMBED_*` env vars: local Ollama by default, OpenAI-compatible endpoints when configured. Switching models invalidates the cache by design; run `kb-calibrate.py` afterwards to check the thresholds against the new model (it proposes values, you set them).
4. **LLM backend** (judge/extraction): `<vault>/.claude/kennisbank-llm.json` or `KB_LLM_*` env vars. Default Ollama `gemma4:latest`; optional OpenRouter uses `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions` through the OpenAI-compatible chat schema.
5. **Wiki categories.** `build-karpathy-index.py` groups articles using a built-in taxonomy; override with a `categories.json` (copy [`categories.example.json`](categories.example.json)).
6. The commands are in Dutch by default (they follow prompt language). Change section headings if you prefer English.
7. Stale threshold (default 60 days): pass `--days N` or edit `stale-check.py`.
8. `auto-crosslink.py` tunables: `MIN_CONFIDENCE` (default `0.75`) and `MAX_NEW_LINKS` (default `5`).
9. Research output path: changing it touches several places (`setup.sh`, the autoresearch skill, and the command prose) - see [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md) section 5.
10. To enable the `/autoresearch` trigger, add this snippet to your global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`:
    ```
    # autoresearch
    - **autoresearch** (`~/.claude/skills/autoresearch/SKILL.md`) - multi-round research with lazy hierarchy check. Output to `~/Claude/research/`. Trigger: `/autoresearch`
    When the user types `/autoresearch`, invoke the Skill tool with `skill: "autoresearch"` before doing anything else.
    ```

## Optional: graphify integration

`auto-crosslink.py` reads from `<vault>/graphify-out/graph.json`, produced by the graphify skill when run on the vault. Without it, the crosslink step is silently skipped. Retrieval benefits indirectly: the graph-neighbour expansion follows the wikilinks that crosslinking maintains.

## Optional: knowledge graph dashboard

[Understand-Anything](https://github.com/Lum1104/Understand-Anything) is a separate Claude Code plugin (MIT) that turns a Karpathy-pattern wiki into an interactive knowledge graph dashboard. Build the required index with `python3 scripts/build-karpathy-index.py`, then run `/understand-knowledge` inside `<vault>/02-wiki`. See `--help` for flags; categories are customizable via `categories.json`.
